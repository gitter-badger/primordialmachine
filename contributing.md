### Signing off commits
The first and most important step for you to do is to agree to our Contributor License Agreement, otherwise we can not accept your contribution.
This is neccessary for us to save your contributions from third-party claims. 

You can find the Contributor License Agreement (CLA) at
[https://github.com/primordialmachine/primordialmachine/cla.md](https://github.com/primordialmachine/primordialmachine/contributor_license_agreement.md).

State that you agree to the CLA in your commits pull request on Github, or state that you agree in a separate Github commit.
The easiest way is to include the following sentence in your commit message
```
I herebey agree to the Contributor's License Agreement (CLA) at https://github.com/primordialmachine/primordialmachine/contributor_license_agreement.md.
```

## Writing proper commit messages

Your commit message should follow the 50/72 rule.

The first line of your commit message must be maximum 50 characters long. No more, and (ideally), no less.
The first line should be a single sentence, it should use the imperative form e.g. "Update Foo". Do NOT
terminate that single sentence with a period.

Leave a blank line

Start writing your description. The description can be as verbose as it suits you. Each line in your description should though wrap at the 72nd mark.
